Also a few pneumovax were given to people who had already had one.

The downside is that then patients do not have the other vaccines done opportunistically, where they are eligible, and we also use walk in flu clinics to grab patients who made need a BP check or a check on smoking data or BMI etc.	Mixed opinions	This could be improved. Ideally I would happen automatically, but not sure if there is an IT solution to this and of the effect on IT governance etc. Worth looking into though.

Funding practices to call patients in would be helpful and achieve greater uptake. At the same time a patient leaflet dispelling some of the myths ( it doesn't work, it'll give me flu) around the flu jab could be given in a bid to improve uptake. Also we could be encouraging carers who often don't come forward for the jab because they don't realise they are entitled to come forward.	No	No - often one patient at a time. Far too many bits of paper. Incomplete lists. Many patients have had the flu jab at a pharmacy and they have not told the GP. We are subsequently wasting time chasing. NHSE should be coordinating informing practices which patients have been vaccinated. ie if NHSE knows which pt's flu jab its paying the pharmacist for then NHSE should be passing this pt number to the relevant practice. (On batch obviously!- not one by one!)

I would like it removed from GP targets , and removed from GP target thresholded payments: As Gps, we cannot in any case keep track of who has had it if it available elsewhere, as it indeed already  is. Much phoning and chasing, a waste of our time. And this year, the vaccine covered only 3% of circulating flu germs. So there is an ethical issue, which will re-double if coverage is as low as 3% next year - patients should have choice and not be cajoled by the medical profession into having something of dubious benefit, that helps line the GPs' pocket.	No	Very few of the pharmacy given injections, are actually notified to the GP. Elsewhere vaccinations are generally discovered when phoning and chasing the patient.

Yes	yes it was easy to enter in to medical notes however it was extra work load for practice admin staff with out any extra payments. when practice vaccinte it was only matter of clinician to enter into patients medical record template. no admin support required. but for pharmacy they are getting paid for vaccination and practice staff are doing extra work for them free. ( with no cost). and patient are getting vaccine twice free.( what a quality of service NHs is providing to patients!)

This year was a real struggle. We made many contacts with patients via letters/phone calls (added expense to the practice) to find that pharmacists had administered but not notified us. When local pharmacists were contacted, some patients had been vaccinated as far back as 4-6 weeks!!  It doesn't look very efficient from the patient's perception, was far more labour intensive & therefore costly from the practice point of view.  We've run these clinics very efficiently for many years & offer flexible appointment times to patients - let us continue to do them please.

Pts tell us they were vaccinated but nothing in notes as no info received.  Difficult for us to plan flu campaigns/vaccination orders - pharmacies receive stock earlier than GP practices.  We like to take BP and pulse at same time as flu vacc - this is not done at pharmacies - seeing pts over 65 for flu vaccs allows us to have contact with those who do not usually attend.	Mixed opinions	Yes easy to enter - difficult to get all the info

The flu vaccine take up amongst our patients was approx the same as previous years with the extra added admin work for the vaccines given by the pharmacies and the return of our unused vaccines to the supplier.Many people who attend for the flu vaccine don't come all year, opportunistic B/P checks and blood test requests can be done with the flu vaccine, if it's a drop in surgery we make a follow up for the patient to come back to the surgery. When the vaccines are done at the pharmacy these patients are missed.	Mixed opinions	We have had some notifications 3 times or more for the same patient.

Something you have not asked about is all the vaccinations we do opportunistically on patients with appointments and their relatives and carers who turn up with them, and of course at home visits. This accounts for  around 20% of our vaccines. The other problem is the poor media coverage, so many people refuse vaccinations in the UK due to a poor understanding of how they work and adverse publicity. You have also not included HCAs in this survey who do the bulk of our vaccinations.

One important point is get the information sent promptly and not multiple times, by email to a nominated nhs.net account seems to work well. There is a small risk of double vaccinations so Pharmacists need to ensure they inform the patient, also there is a small risk that the pharmacist didn't give the jab but recorded as being done so because the patient didn't wait etc. Loss of income is not an issue as reaching the target is more important for us and the amount is very small. Thanks NHS England for a good and practical idea! :)	Yes	Entering a 'flu vaccine' record is very easy and quick

It is important for the record keeping that we are aware of immunisations, particularly if it is part of our Contractual obligations. It is a further unknown how many clinics we should put on if we don't know who is likely to attend and who isn't. Similarly with how many vaccines to buy.  It also means if they don't come in they miss the opportunity to have Shingles / Pneumonia offered to them.  Finally we use flu season to ensure other items outstanding in their health (QOF / Enhanced Services) are discussed and patients offered appointments to cover outstanding actions.  Patients are ultimately losing out as a result by not attending the surgery for their appointment.	Yes	If we receive them but we don't always!
