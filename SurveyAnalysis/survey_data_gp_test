Something you have not asked about is all the vaccinations we do opportunistically on patients with appointments and their relatives and carers who turn up with them, and of course at home visits. This accounts for  around 20% of our vaccines. The other problem is the poor media coverage, so many people refuse vaccinations in the UK due to a poor understanding of how they work and adverse publicity. You have also not included HCAs in this survey who do the bulk of our vaccinations.

No	If you're going to continue with using external agencies/agents to give vaccinations then there should be real time update of patient's records electronically. We will NOT be ordering so many flu vaccines in future and will not be doing extra flu clinics anymore IF the Pharmacists/others are used WITHOUT records being updated electronically accurately (WITHOUT INVOLVING ME OR MY STAFF!).

One important point is get the information sent promptly and not multiple times, by email to a nominated nhs.net account seems to work well. There is a small risk of double vaccinations so Pharmacists need to ensure they inform the patient, also there is a small risk that the pharmacist didn't give the jab but recorded as being done so because the patient didn't wait etc. Loss of income is not an issue as reaching the target is more important for us and the amount is very small. Thanks NHS England for a good and practical idea! :)	Yes	Entering a 'flu vaccine' record is very easy and quick

Also, one pharmacist decided to do all the patients in one of our residential homes.  We have been immunising them for over 10 years.  No-one told us and the nurse who went to do them only found out when she got there.  A waste of the nurse's time.	Yes

It is important for the record keeping that we are aware of immunisations, particularly if it is part of our Contractual obligations. It is a further unknown how many clinics we should put on if we don't know who is likely to attend and who isn't. Similarly with how many vaccines to buy.  It also means if they don't come in they miss the opportunity to have Shingles / Pneumonia offered to them.  Finally we use flu season to ensure other items outstanding in their health (QOF / Enhanced Services) are discussed and patients offered appointments to cover outstanding actions.  Patients are ultimately losing out as a result by not attending the surgery for their appointment.	Yes	If we receive them but we don't always!
